# uP2_Final_Project

## About

- This project involves the RTOS that I made for my class and it is my own venture into game physics.
- I wanted to create something that involved IoT at first but soon realized that it would involve a lot more setup than I was ready for at that point, so I focused on creating a game that I was familiar with...basketball
- This game is called NBA 67K, really dating when it was created and is just a simple arcade basketball game against a pseudo-ai
